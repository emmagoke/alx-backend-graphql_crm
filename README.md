## Overview

GraphQL is a powerful query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook, that allows clients to request exactly the data they need â€” nothing more, nothing less. Unlike REST APIs, which return fixed data structures, GraphQL gives clients the flexibility to shape the response format.

We will explore the foundations of GraphQL, understand its advantages over REST, and learn how to implement GraphQL in Django using libraries like graphene-django.
